# **Computer Science Resume Scoring System for New Graduates**

This scoring system evaluates a resume across seven critical categories, each with a specific weight reflecting its importance in the modern tech hiring landscape. Each category is scored on a scale of 0 to 10, where 10 represents outstanding performance and 0 indicates a complete absence or severe deficiency.

**Overall Score Calculation:**

The total resume score is calculated as a weighted average of the individual category scores:

Overall Score \= (ATS & Formatting Score \* 0.20) \+ (Projects & Experience Score \* 0.25) \+ (Tailoring & Customization Score \* 0.20) \+ (Skills Score \* 0.15) \+ (Digital Footprint Score \* 0.10) \+ (Summary/Objective Score \* 0.05) \+ (Education & Certifications Score \* 0.05)

**Category Scoring Guidelines (0-10 Scale):**

* **0-2: Poor/Missing** \- Fails to meet basic requirements or is entirely absent.  
* **3-5: Needs Improvement** \- Meets some requirements but has significant weaknesses.  
* **6-7: Good** \- Meets most requirements, solid but could be more impactful.  
* **8-9: Excellent** \- Exceeds expectations, highly effective.  
* **10: Outstanding** \- Flawless execution, truly stands out.
