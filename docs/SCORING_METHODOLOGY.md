# Resume Scoring Methodology

This document outlines the comprehensive scoring methodology used by the Resume Analyzer, based on extensive research of computer science hiring practices and industry standards.

## üìä Overall Scoring Framework

### Weighted Category System

The Resume Analyzer evaluates resumes across **seven critical categories**, each with specific weights reflecting their importance in modern tech hiring:

```
Overall Score = (ATS & Formatting √ó 0.20) + 
                (Projects & Experience √ó 0.25) + 
                (Tailoring & Customization √ó 0.20) + 
                (Skills √ó 0.15) + 
                (Digital Footprint √ó 0.10) + 
                (Summary/Objective √ó 0.05) + 
                (Education & Certifications √ó 0.05)
```
