# Project Work Diary

This document tracks the progress, decisions, and next steps for the Resume Analyzer project.

## Session: 2025-07-12

### Done:
- **Standardized Project Structure & Documentation:**
  - Established and documented coding standards in `docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md`.
  - Updated the project roadmap in `docs/project_plan/ROADMAP.md` with a clear MVP phase.
  - Added `README.md` files to all major directories (`/`, `backend/`, `frontend/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, `backend/agents/`).
  - Added standard file headers (author, date) to all backend Python scripts, `Dockerfile`, and `docker-compose.yml`.
  - Added comprehensive Google-style docstrings and type hints to all backend agent, task, and crew orchestration files (`*.py`).
- **Implemented Core Backend Logic:**
  - Developed a functional `/analyze` endpoint in `backend/main.py` using FastAPI.
  - The endpoint now handles PDF file uploads, text extraction, and orchestration of the CrewAI agent analysis.
  - Implemented robust error handling and response models.
- **Refined Agent Definitions:**
  - Simplified and clarified the goals for all analysis agents.
  - Ensured all agent files conform to the new documentation standards.

### In Progress (WIP):
- None.

### Immediate Next Steps:
- **Frontend Development:**
  - Begin scaffolding the React frontend application.
  - Create the main UI component for uploading a resume file.
  - Implement the API call to the backend `/analyze` endpoint.
- **Testing:**
  - Develop an initial set of unit and integration tests for the backend API and agent crew.
- **Environment Configuration:**
  - Finalize environment variable management for API keys and other secrets.

### Done:
- **FastAPI + Gemini 2.5 Integration:**
  - Successfully validated the `/v1/test-gemini` endpoint.
  - FastAPI backend and Gemini 2.5 LLM are now fully integrated and working together.
  - The system is "always working" and ready for agent scaffolding.
  - Project structure and documentation updated to reflect this milestone.
- **ATS Agent API Integration Validated:**
  - Successfully validated the `/v1/ats-agent` endpoint.
  - ATS & Formatting Agent is now callable and returns structured results.
  - System remains "always working" and ready for next steps.
- **Agent Prompt Integration:**
  - All agent scripts now use both the global (`prompt_requirements.md`) and agent-specific prompt requirement files for prompt engineering.
  - Created missing agent-specific prompt files for each agent in `backend/agents/`.
  - Verified LLM connectivity and prompt usage for all agents via integration tests. Each agent returns a response from the LLM using the correct prompt files.
  - Maintained "always working" backend: all endpoints respond and connect to the LLM, even if output parsing is deferred for now.

### In Progress (WIP):
- None.

### Immediate Next Steps:
- **Agent Scaffolding:**
  - Begin scaffolding the agents to be used in the analysis.
  - Define clear interfaces and contracts for each agent.
- **Extended Testing:**
  - Implement end-to-end tests covering the complete flow from file upload to analysis report.
- **Performance Tuning:**
  - Monitor and optimize the performance of the FastAPI endpoints and Gemini integrations.
- Refine LLM output parsing for robust JSON extraction (including code blocks and nested structures).
- Expand integration tests to cover richer agent features and multi-field requests.
- Update documentation and commit after each milestone.
