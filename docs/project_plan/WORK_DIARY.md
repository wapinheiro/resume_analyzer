## Session: 2025-07-12

### Done:
- **Standardized Project Structure & Documentation:**
  - Established and documented coding standards in `docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md`.
  - Updated the project roadmap in `docs/project_plan/ROADMAP.md` with a clear MVP phase.
  - Added `README.md` files to all major directories (`/`, `backend/`, `frontend/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, `backend/agents/`).
  - Added standard file headers (author, date) to all backend Python scripts, `Dockerfile`, and `docker-compose.yml`.
  - Added comprehensive Google-style docstrings and type hints to all backend agent, task, and crew orchestration files (`*.py`).
- **Implemented Core Backend Logic:**
  - Developed a functional `/analyze` endpoint in `backend/main.py` using FastAPI.
  - The endpoint now handles PDF file uploads, text extraction, and orchestration of the CrewAI agent analysis.
  - Implemented robust error handling and response models.
- **Refined Agent Definitions:**
  - Simplified and clarified the goals for all analysis agents.
  - Ensured all agent files conform to the new documentation standards.

### In Progress (WIP):
- None.

### Immediate Next Steps:
- **Frontend Development:**
  - Begin scaffolding the React frontend application.
  - Create the main UI component for uploading a resume file.
  - Implement the API call to the backend `/analyze` endpoint.
- **Testing:**
  - Develop an initial set of unit and integration tests for the backend API and agent crew.
- **Environment Configuration:**
  - Finalize environment variable management for API keys and other secrets.
