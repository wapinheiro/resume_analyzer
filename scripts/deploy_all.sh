# MASTER DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT
# =============================================================================
# This script orchestrates the entire deployment process for the Resume Analyzer.
# It sources configuration from `deployment.config.sh` and then executes the
# backend and frontend deployment scripts in sequence.
#
# USAGE:
# 1. Ensure you have authenticated with Google Cloud (`gcloud auth login`) and
#    Firebase (`firebase login`).
# 2. Ensure you have the necessary IAM permissions for the target projects.
# 3. Run this script from the `scripts` directory:
#    ./deploy_all.sh
# =============================================================================

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
